# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed
- Binary operators overloading is now supported.
- Captured values in functions are now immutable.
  - e.g.
    ```
    x = 100
    f = |n|
      x = x + n # Assigning to x here now only affects the local copy of x
    debug f 42  # 142
    debug x     # 100 - The value of x in this scope is unchanged
    ```
  - Captured values can now be thought of as 'hidden arguments' for a function
    rather than 'hidden mutable state', which simplifies things quite a bit.
  - If mutable state is required then you can use a list or map, e.g.
    ```
    state = {x: 100}
    f = |n|
      state.x = state.x + n # The function has a local copy of the state,
                            # which shares its data with the outer scope's copy.
    debug f 42    # 142
    debug state.x # 142
    ```
- Runtime errors now provide a full backtrace.


## [0.6.0] 2021.01.21

### Added
- Core Ops
  - `range.expanded`
  - `range.union`

### Changed
- Function calls without parentheses now require commas to separate arguments.
  - e.g. `f a b c` now needs to be written as `f a, b, c`.
  - Care needs to be taken when adapting programs to this change.
    - e.g. `f a, b c` was parsed as two separate expressions
      (i.e. `(f a), (b c)`), and it's now parsed as `f(a, (b c))`.
- `match` when used without a value to match against has been renamed to
  `switch`.
- Error messages in core ops that call functors have been made a bit clearer.
- Core ops that accept function arguments can now take external functions.
  - e.g.
    ```
    x = [[1, 2, 3], [1], [1, 2]]
    x.sort list.size
    assert_eq x [[1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3]]
    ```
- The `Koto` struct now returns a concrete error type instead of a `String`.
- It's no longer necessary to call helper functions to get formatted source
  extracts for errors.
- Whitespace is no longer required after operators,
  e.g. `1+1==2` would previously trigger a parsing error.

### Fixed
- Error messages produced in the functor passed to `iterator.fold` were reported
  as coming from `iterator.each`.
- Error messages associated with accessed IDs now have the correct spans.
  - e.g.
    ```
    x = (1..10).fold 42

    ```
    Previously the error (wrong arguments for `.fold`) would be connected with
    the range rather than the function call.


## [0.5.0] 2020.12.17

### Added
- Core Ops
  - `iterator.chain`
  - `iterator.product`
  - `iterator.sum`
  - `list.clear`
  - `list.swap`
  - `map.clear`
  - `map.get_index`
  - `map.sort`
  - `number.is_nan`
  - `number.to_float`
  - `number.to_int`
  - `os.cpu_count`
  - `os.physical_cpu_count`
  - `string.ends_with`
  - `string.starts_with`
  - `tuple.first`
  - `tuple.last`
  - `tuple.sort_copy`
- Core Constants
  - `number.e`
  - `number.infinity`
  - `number.nan`
  - `number.negative_infinity`
- `match` improvements
  - `else` can be now used as the fallback arm in a match expression.
  - The value to match against is now optional, and when it's ommitted then
    so are match patterns.
    - e.g.
      ```
      n = 0
      match
        n == 0 then "zero"
        n == 1 then "one"
        else "???"
      ```
    - *Note* (20.12.2020): After v0.5.0 this form of expression was renamed to
      `switch`.
  - The results of list/map accesses or function calls can be used as match
    patterns.
    - e.g.
      ```
      match x
        f y then "x == f y"
        m.foo then "x == m.foo"
        z[10] then "x == z[10]"
      ```
  - match arms that have indented bodies can now optionally use `then`,
    which can look clearer when the match pattern is short.
    - e.g.
      ```
      match x
        0 then # <-- `then` was previously disallowed here
          "zero"
        1 then
          "one"
      ```
- Tuples may now be added to lists with the `+` and `+=` operators.
  - e.g.
    ```
    x = [1, 2] + (3, 4)
    assert_eq x [1, 2, 3, 4]
    ```

### Changed
- `thread.join` now returns the result of the thread's function.
- Numbers now can either be integers or floats.
  - The integer representation is `i64`.
  - Arithmetic involving only integers will produce an integer result,
    otherwise the result will be floating point.
- The RWLock implementation used in Koto is now the one from
  [parking_lot](https://crates.io/crates/parking_lot).
  - Performance improvements of up to 13% were seen in testing.
- Accessing the runtime's prelude is now performed via `Koto::prelude()` rather
  than via `Koto::context_mut()`, which has been removed.
  - The prelude was the only reason to expose the context, so it's cleaner to
    make this explicit.
  - Behind this change is a small performance improvement whereby core
    operations have one RWLock fewer to get past.
- `list.sort` and `map.sort` can now take an optional function to customize the
  sorting behaviour.
- The ordering of entries is now preserved when calling `map.remove`.


### Fixed
- `else` and `else if` blocks with unexpected indentation will now trigger a
  parser error.
- Multi-assignment of values where the values are used in the expressions now
  works as expected.
  - e.g.
    ```
    a, b = 1, 2
    a, b = b, a
    # Previously this would result in b being re-assigned to itself
    assert_eq b 1
    ```
- Generator functions can now capture non-local values.
- `1.exp()` is now parsed correctly as a number followed by a call to `exp()`,
  rather than `1.e` followed by `xp()`.
- `string.split` now works correctly when used with multi-character patterns.



## [0.4.0] 2020.12.10

### Added
- Core Ops
  - `iterator.min_max`
  - `list.copy`
  - `list.deep_copy`
  - `map.copy`
  - `map.deep_copy`
  - `map.update`
  - `tuple.deep_copy`
- Strings are now iterable by default
- Tuples or lists in function arguments can be unpacked automatically.
  - e.g. `f = |a, (b, [c, d])| a + b + c + d`
- Num2 and num4 values can now used in unpacking expressions
  - e.g.
    ```
    x = num2 1 2
    a, b = x
    assert_eq b 2
    ```

### Fixed
- iterator.consume and iterator.count now propagate errors correctly.
- Wildcard function args that weren't in last position would cause arguments to
  be assigned to the wrong IDs.

### Removed
- The copy expression has been removed in favour of copy / deep_copy operations
  on container types.


## [0.3.0] - 2020.12.06

### Added
- Core Ops
  - `iterator.all`
  - `iterator.any`
  - `iterator.max`
  - `iterator.min`
  - `iterator.position`
  - `iterator.skip`
  - `string.size`
- Strings can now be used with the ordered comparison operators.

### Changed
- Map blocks can now be used in return and yield expressions.
- `iterator.each` and `iterator.keep` now collect iterator pairs into tuples.
- Space-separated function calls are allowed in function args when the arg is on
  a new line.
- Unparenthesized expressions can now be used for range boundaries.
  - e.g. `(1 + 1)..(2 + 2)` can now be written as `1 + 1..2 + 2`.

### Removed
- Vim support has been moved to [its own repo][vim].

### Fixed
- `iterator.fold`, `list.retain`, and `list.transform` could cause runtime
  errors or stack overflows when being called after other functions.
